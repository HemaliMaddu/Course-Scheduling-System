# Course-Scheduling-System
Problem Description

The computer science department in a university offers many courses every semester, which are taught by many instructors. These courses are scheduled based on some policy directions of the department. Currently the scheduling is done manually, but the department would like to automate it. We have to first understand the problem and then produce a requirements document based on our understanding of the problem.

The system is analysed by documenting the SRS and designing various UML diagrams.

The front-end GUI of the system is designed using Java Swing with data storage in MYSQL.
